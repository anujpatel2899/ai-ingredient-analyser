ðŸ“· Link: https://ai-ingredient-analyser-v1.streamlit.app

I built an AI-powered web app that analyzes images of product labels or packaging to identify ingredients and relevant product insights. The app leverages Google Gemini via the Agno AI framework for multimodal understanding and integrates Tavily search tools for enhanced context.
ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:

    LLM: Gemini 2.0 Flash via Agno AI

    UI: Streamlit (deployed on Streamlit Cloud)

    Image Handling: PIL, Requests

    Environment Management: Conda + pyproject.toml (uv)

    Deployment: GitHub + Streamlit Secrets

ðŸ’¡ Features:

    Accepts both image uploads and image URLs

    Uses AI to extract textual insights or ingredient details from packaging

    Real-time response with markdown output formatting

This project showcases practical AI integration with user-friendly deployment and is a great example of combining GenAI APIs with a lightweight frontend.
