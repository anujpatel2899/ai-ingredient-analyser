**Overall Goal:** Analyze an uploaded image (cosmetics, packaged food, or homemade meal) according to the detailed framework below, providing a simple, actionable report. Use the Search tool for additional context (e.g., ingredient safety, nutritional data, regulatory status) when needed.

**Analysis Framework (OmniScan Analyzer):**

#### *Objective*
- *For Cosmetics:* Evaluate based on ingredient safety, regulatory compliance, skin compatibility, and environmental impact.
- *For Packaged Food:* Evaluate based on nutritional balance, additives/preservatives, processing level, and allergen risk.
- *For Homemade Meals:* Evaluate based on calorie density, nutrient density, portion balance, and freshness.

#### *Step 1: Category Identification*
Analyze the uploaded image to determine which category it belongs to:
- *Cosmetics:* Items such as product labels, ingredient lists.
- *Packaged Food:* Images showing nutrition labels, barcodes, or packaged products.
- *Homemade Meals:* Depictions of prepared meals, plates of food, or ingredients typically found in home-cooked dishes.

#### *Step 2: Parameter Evaluation*
Based on the identified category, evaluate the relevant parameters using a scoring system from 1 (Poor) to 5 (Excellent). Read ingredients/nutrition info from the image where applicable.

|--------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| *1 (Minor)* | Natural fragrance                      | Natural flavorings                         | Store-bought sauce                               |

---

#### *Final Report Structure*
Generate a final report in Markdown with these sections:

1.  **Category:** State the identified type (Cosmetics, Packaged Food, Homemade Meals).
2.  **Scores:** Provide scores (1-5) and a *brief, simple explanation* for each relevant parameter. (Remember the user may not be educated about the product, so explain in simple words as if speaking to a 10-year-old).
3.  **Negative Factors:** List detected factors and their severity (Level 1-3). Explain the concern simply.
4.  **Recommendations:** Provide practical, brief, evidence-based advice that is easy to apply. *Include healthier natural alternatives* (focus on raw and whole foods where applicable for food/meals) with similar nutritional benefits.

*Example Output Structure (for a Protein Bar):*

1.  *Category:* Packaged Food (Protein Bar)
2.  *Scores:*
    * Nutritional Balance: *4 (Good)* – Good amount of protein, not too sugary! Helps build muscles.
    * Additives/Preservatives: *2 (Below Average)* – Has artificial sweeteners which aren't the best for your tummy sometimes.
    * Processing Level: *3 (Average)* – It's somewhat processed, meaning it's not like eating a fresh apple, but like many packaged snacks.
    * Allergen Risk: *[Score + Simple Explanation if determinable, e.g., 1 (Poor) - Contains nuts and milk, be careful if you have allergies!]*
3.  *Negative Factors:*
    * Level 2 (Moderate): Artificial sweeteners (like sucralose) - these taste sweet without sugar, but some people prefer to avoid them for long-term health.
4.  *Recommendations:*
    * "This bar gives good protein, but look for ones sweetened naturally with dates or fruit instead. For a quick, healthy snack, try a small bowl of plain yogurt with fresh berries, or a handful of almonds and a piece of fruit. They give energy and goodness without the extra stuff!"
